Instructions for Accessing rec.puzzles Archive

INTRODUCTION

Below is a list of puzzles, categorized by subject area.  Each puzzle
includes a solution, compiled from various sources, which is supposed
to be definitive.

EMAIL

To request a puzzle, send a message to archive-request@questrel.com like:

return_address your_name@your_site.your_domain
send requested_puzzle_name

For example, if your net address is "mickey@disneyland.com", to request
"decision/allais.p", send the message:

return_address mickey@disneyland.com
send allais

To request multiple puzzles, use several "send" lines in a message.
Please refrain from requesting the entire archive via email.  Use FTP.

FTP

The archive has been posted to news.answers and rec.answers, which are
archived in the periodic posting archive on rtfm.mit.edu in the
anonymous ftp directory /pub/usenet.

Other archives are:

	ftp.cs.ruu.nl [131.211.80.17] in the anonymous ftp
		directory /pub/NEWS.ANSWERS (also accessible via mail
		server requests to mail-server@cs.ruu.nl)
	cnam.cnam.fr [192.33.159.6] in the anonymous ftp directory /pub/FAQ
	ftp.uu.net [137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9] in the anonymous ftp
		directory /usenet
	ftp.win.tue.nl [131.155.70.100] in the anonymous ftp directory
		/pub/usenet/news.answers
	grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr [134.214.100.25] in the anonymous ftp
		directory /pub/faq (also accessible via mail server
		requests to listserv@grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr), which is
		best used by EASInet sites and sites in France that do
		not have better connectivity to cnam.cnam.fr (e.g.
		Lyon, Grenoble)

Note that the periodic posting archives on rtfm.mit.edu are also
accessible via Prospero and WAIS (the database name is "usenet" on port
210).

CREDIT

The archive is NOT the original work of the editor (just in case you were
wondering :^).

In keeping with the general net practice on FAQ's, I do not as a rule assign
credit for solutions.  There are many reasons for this:
1.  The archive is about the answers to the questions, not about assigning
    credit.
2.  Many people, in providing free answers to the net, do not have the time
    to cite their sources.
3.  I cut and paste freely from several people's solutions in most cases
    to come up with as complete an answer as possible.
4.  I use sources other than postings.
5.  I am neither qualified nor motivated to assign credit.

However, I do whenever possible put bibliographies in archive entries, and
I see the inclusion of the net addresses of interested parties as a
logical extension of this practice.  In particular, if you wrote a
program to solve a problem and posted the source code of the program,
you are presumed to be interested in corresponding with others about
the problem.  So, please let me know the entries you would like to be
listed in and I will be happy to oblige.

Address corrections or comments to archive-comment@questrel.com.
