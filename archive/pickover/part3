Consider a metallic slide with 10 large holes in it equally spaced from
top to bottom.  If you attempt to slide down the slide you have a 50%
probability of sliding through each hole in the slide into an oleaginous
substance beneath the slide during each encounter with a hole.

None.  The best chance is the first hole but I got a 50-50 chance.  Why

No gurantee.  Each slide is an independent event.  Now, if you are
talking mere probability, on the average, one in 1024 slides may make
it through all 10 holes.

Again, can't tell.  It could be the first one, it could be none.  Probablity
can not foretell actual events.  But if you have infinite number of people
sliding down till eternity, on the average, you may see 1 person slide over
all holes every (2**100)/(365*24*69*6) years.  This number is many times
bigger than the world population for now.

The chance of falling thru the first hole is 50%.  For the second hole, it

The sum of the prob for falling thru a hole is .5 + .5^2 + .5^3 +...+.5^10.

this is about 9.647 x 10^23 years, much older than the universe if I remeber

Also, the chance of making it must be GREATER than .5^101.  or with

The first one. There's only a 50% chance of them getting past it, and a
small chance of them falling into each succeeding hole.
hole #     percent chance of reaching and falling into
1            50

The chances for reaching each succeeding hole are the same as reaching and
falling into the previous one. Therefore, the chances of passing all the
holes are the same as reaching and falling into the last hole  (see previous
answer for stats), which makes the probability .0009765625, so
statistically, 1024 slides would be required to guarantee reaching the
bottom. If I was a gambling person, I'd probably bet about half this,
because the actual events can happen in any order, and on average, I'd guess
that he'd get down in about 512 slides.

>An hour? A day? A decade? ...

This is solved similarly; it is represented by powers of 2. To successfully
get past the last hole, it would require (statistically, at least) 2^100
or (by my trusty pocket calculator) 1.2676506 *10^30 slides.
More significant figures? dc! Which gives 1267650600228229401496703205376.
In similar logic as the last problem, I'd expect about half that, or
633825300114114700748351602688 slides. How much time would this be? Excluding
leap years, I calculate 20098468420665737593491 years. That's 20 sextillion
years, significantly more than the age of the universe, by about 11 orders
of magnitude. So I'd guess that no one will ever reach the bottom, they'll
all try and fail (assuming everyone only gets to go once), or die waiting in
line.

it through all 10 holes.

-------------------------

Some answers to your questions:

1. As the puzzle states there is a 50% chance of falling into each
hole, I would bet a person would fall into the first hole -- in a large
enough sample, 1/2 of the people will fall through the first hole, 1/4
through the second, 1/8 through the third, etc.

2. In a large sample, 1/(2^10) people would make it all the way down
the slide without falling through any of the holes (1/1024). This means
that 1023 out of 1024 people would fall through a hole. Using the
formula (1023/1024)^x=1/2, we can determine out of the first x people
to go down the slide, there is a 50% chance that one person will make
it down without falling through a hole.  The answer to this equation is
x=709.4 Thus I would bet that a person would make it all the way down
on one of the first 710 attempts.

3. As 2^100=1.2676*10^30 (roughly), and (including leaps years under
the Gregorian calendar) there are 31556952 seconds in the average year,
then statistically one person should make it down the slide every
4.017*10^22 YEARS. However, and this is a very rough estimate, I figure
the log of (1-1/(1.2676*10^30)) to be about -5.5*10^(-29). [I'm doing
the calculations on a scientific calculator which only has 10 places.]
Thus, using the formula xlog(1-1/2^100)=log(1/2), I get x=5.5*10^27.
Thus, there's about a 50% chance that after 5.5*10^27 seconds, someone
will have made it down the slide. To be on the safe side, I'd bet only
if I were given at least 6*10^27 seconds, a value which equals
1.901*10^20 YEARS.

I hope this answers the questions.

There's a 50% chance of falling through the first hole, 25% the
second, 2^-n the n'th.  If the odds offered were the same, I'd go for
the first hole.

>2.  If you were a gambling person, how many attempts would it require

You expect to make it 1 out of 1024 times; after 710 tries, the chance
of someone succeeding exceeds 1/2.  (Log base (1023/1024) of 1/2 is
709.4).

Never.  OK, 1/2^100 will make it.  There being under 2^33 people on
the planet, ...

After 4.2e22 years, the expected number of people who succeeded is 1;
after about 2.9e22 years, the chance of someone having succeeded is
about 1/2.

Like I said, never.

In rec.puzzles you write:

>1.  If you were a gambling person, which hole would you bet a person
>would fall through?

If the pay-back odds were the same regardless of the hole, then obviously,
I'd bet on the first hole!  There's a 1:2 chance the person falls through
the first hole, a 1:4 combined chance of the person falling though the
second hole, etc...

>2.  If you were a gambling person, how many attempts would it require
>for a person to slide from the top of the slide to the bottom without
>falling through a single hole.

1024 is the median value for this case...  There's a 1:2**n chance of
a person falling through the nth hole, having missed all of the holes
before n.  Since the probability of falling through = the probability
passing over the hole safely (vs not ever getting there), the
probability that a person makes it to the end is also 1:1024.

>An hour? A day? A decade? ...
There is a 1:2**(100-Log2(5 billion people)) chance that somebody makes
it through...  Given a finite # of people on the planet (approx 5 bil.)
I think we'll run out first...

The probability of falling into hole i is (1/2)^i, so your best bet
would be hole 1.

The probability of success is p = (1/2)^10, and as each trial is
independant the expected number of trials before success is 1/p or
2^10.

In this case the number of expected trials is 2^100, which is much
larger than the total number of people.

Try about 10^24 years.  As another problem, assuming a large enough
supply of sliders estimate when the slide will wear through from
friction.

I'd bet that they fell through the first hole.  The probability of that
happening is 50%.  The probability of them falling through the second
hole is:
P(didn't fall through the first)*P(fell through the second) = 50%*50% = 25%

In general, P(falls through hole n)=
P(no fall through 1)*P(no fall through 2)*...*P(no fall through n-1)
 *P(fell through hole n).
For this problem, P(falls through hole n) is (50%)^n, where n is the hole #
from the top.

>2.  If you were a gambling person, how many attempts would it require
>for a person to slide from the top of the slide to the bottom without

(Hey, after the first failed attempt, they're screwed, no?)
P(success)=P(no fail)=P(no fall 1)P(no fall 2)...P(no fall 10)
 =50%^10
 =1/1024
They should make it at least one time in 1024.

Oh, one in about 4.02*10^22 years...  I wouldn't hold my breath.


-Richard
-------------------------

1. I would bet on the first hole, as there is a 0.5 probability of a person's
   falling into it, which is the highest such probability.

2. The probability of reaching the end of the slide on a particular try is
   1/2^10 = 1/1024.  In 709 tries, there is an approximately 0.5 probability of

3. Beats me - the even money bet is for a number of tries (approximately) equal
          ((2^100 - 1)/(2^100))
   calculate it.

Title: Cliff Puzzle 13: Ladders to Heaven
From: cliff@watson.ibm.com

If you respond to this puzzle, if possible please send me your name,
address, affiliation, e-mail address, so I can properly credit you if
you provide unique information.  PLEASE ALSO directly mail me a copy of
your response in addition to any responding you do in the newsgroup.  I
will assume it is OK to describe your answer in any article or

      * * *

Consider the following scenario.  A standard ladder stretches from each
country on the earth upward a distance equal to the distance from the
earth to the moon.

Assume:
1. the ladder is made out of a strong metal such as
titanium, which will not break.
2. the ladder is inclined at a very steep angle, 70 degrees, for
each country.
3. there is a breathable atmosphere.
4. the people (or teams of people) are allowed to use standard
mountain climbing and camping gear, e.g. ropes, backpacks, etc. but not
sophisticated electrical mechanisms, engines, etc.
5. a reward is given to whomever reaches the top of the ladder
first: 1 million dollars to that person.  In addition the country's
national debt is wiped out.

Questions:
1.  Approximate how long it would take a person (or team of people) to
reach the top of the ladder.  Days?  Weeks?  Years?

2. Which country would be the first?

3. Is there any novel method you would suggest to achieve this goal?

4. Is this task impossible to carry out.

==> pickover/pickover.13.s <==
-------------------------

Interesting puzzle... Just one question though: Is there a moon,
i.e. is it possible to use the gravitational field of the moon to your
advantage by "falling upwards" once you have reached the point where
the moon's gravity is bigger than the erath's (and do we also assume that
the the climber(s) must survive the fall?? :-) or shall we assume that the
earth is alone in the universe?

Note that after you're 22,300 miles from the earth's axis, you get to
"fall" the rest of the way, as long as you don't lose contact with
the ladder.
	
>2. Which country would be the first?

It has already been pointed out that countries on the equator have an
advantage.  I suppose you could consider that countries with a large
national debt have extra motivation.  :-)

>3. Is there any novel method you would suggest to achieve this goal?

I would suggest a bicycle-like vehicle clamped to the ladder.  By
pulling a light but strong rope on a pulley (perhaps obtained form
the same source as this fantastic ladder material), riders could be
changed fairly quickly, thanks to a crew of brawny pulley-pullers
with a variable-geared linkage to the rope.

For the rider to pull this ever-longer rope seems impossible, but I
think shorter segments could be lifted and linked.  Or the ground
crew could help the rider by pulling down rope from a hub of lesser
diameter than the wheels of the vehicle.

>4. Is this task impossible to carry out.

No.  I thought it might be impossible to halt at the far end of the
ladder and return, due to centrifugal acceleration, but that
acceleration turns out to be only about 5 cm/s^2.

> How do we get food to the people?

I would have the riders change so often that they'd only need some
high-carbohydrate snacks and a couple quarts of fluid.  I think the
brawny ground crew could pull up the next rider, with his supplies
and another pulley and segment of rope, at an acceleration of about
0.5 g or better.  That would be under 90 minutes for each shift-
change up to the synchronous orbit level.

I haven't figured out yet how to link each new piece of rope that's
pulled up with a rider to the pulley that's at the high point reached
by the previous rider.  Linking is easy, but it would be nice to find
a way that lets the next pulled-up rider go from one segment to the
other without interruption.  Well, since the sky-buckets at
Disneyland do this trick at each end, I know it can be done.

I didn't know you'd written any books, but it was clear you're
working on one now.  Sure, send a list, but I have access to some
on-line catalogs, so maybe I can find them anyway.

I would imagine that one would be able to fashion a hot air balloon given
condition 4.  Also, given condition 3, the hot air balloon would be able
to cover the entire distance.  One would then only need to attach a sliding
hookup between the ladder and the balloon and wait.

Christopher Columbus would be a national hero, instead of being vulnerable
to counter-claims of genocide.  America would have been settled several
decades later, due to a dearth of demonstrable natural resources.

Okay, administrative trivia first.  My name is Martin Eiger, you don't
need my address (home or business?), I don't want you citing my
affiliation if you quote me, and my e-mail address is
mie@thumper.bellcore.com.

>1.  How would the world be different today, geopolitically speaking, if
>the ancient land masses had never drifted apart and, therefore,

My theory is that mankind would never have evolved.  The dominant
species would still be some sort of mammal, but not us.  This renders
a large number of geopolitical questions irrelevant.  For example,
elephant-like creatures are unlikely to care whether there is one or
two Germanys.


>2.  What would today's world be like if the land mass which formed the
>Greek peninsula never existed?

A tough one, since I'm not up on my Greek influences in the evolution
of civilization.  My guess is that civilization would have evolved
anyway, probably not too differently than it did.  It might not have
evolved as fast, i.e., we might now be where we were a thousand years
ago or so, but over the long haul, human history would follow a
similar course.


>3.  What would today's world be like if the land bridge which joined
>Alaska to Asia never existed?

Pretty much the same, I bet.  People would have colonized North
America anyway.  After all, they got to Hawaii, so somebody could
probably have gotten to North America.  And whether or not people
colonized North America from across the Pacific, people from Europe
would have paved the place over just the same.


>4.  Why do all the major peninsulas on earth point south?  See for
>example:  Italy, Greece, Florida, and Baja, and the tips of Africa,

First of all, you have to define what's a major peninsula.  Secondly,
I don't like your list.  Norway and Sweden are on the same peninsula,
and Greenland is an island, not a peninsula.  And third, there are
plenty of perfectly fine peninsulas that don't point south:  Alaska,
Siberia, Michigan (two peninsulas for the price of one), Yucatan,
Arabia (points kind of southeast), and Iberia, for instance.  And
fourth, you missed a few good southern-pointing ones, such as Korea,
Crimea, the Sinai, and the one that kind of points from eastern
Siberia toward Japan that I'm sure has a name but I don't know it.  So
while there are lots of peninsulas pointing lots of directions, a
majority of them do seem to point south, and I have no idea why.

Consider a 9x9 grid of beautiful crystal wineglasses.  Throw 32 cherries
at the grid.  A glass is considered occupied if it contains at least one
cherry.  (With each throw a cherry goes into one of the glasses.)  How
many different patterns of occupied glasses can you make?  (A glass with

A square number is of the form y=x**2.  For example, 25 is a square
number.

Undulating numbers are of the form:  ababababab... For example, the
following are undulating numbers:  1717171, 282828, etc.

1. Are there any undulating square numbers?

2. Are there any undulating cube numbers?

343 and 676 aren't trivial (unlike 121 and 484 it doesn't come from
obvious algebraic identities).  The chance that a "random"
number around x should be a perfect square is about 1/sqrt(x);
more generally, x^(-1+1/d) for a perfect d-th power.  Since
there are for each k only 90 k-digit undulants you expect
to find only finitely many of these that are perfect powers,
and none that are very large.  But provably listing all cases
is probably only barely, if at all, possible by present-day
methods for treating exponential Diophantine equations, unless
(as was shown in a rec.puzzles posting re your puzzles on
arith. prog. of squares with common difference 10^k) there is
some ad-hoc trick available.  At any rate the largest undulating
power is probably 69696=264^2, though 211^3=9393931 comes
remarkably close.

Consider the simple yet weird recursive formula

a(n) = a(a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-1))

The sequences starts with a(1) = 1, and a(2) = 1.  The "future" values
at higher values of n depend on past values in intricate recursive ways.
Can you determined the third member of the sequence?  At first, this may
seem a little complicated to evaluate, but you can being slowly, by
inserting values for n, as in the following:

a(3) = a(a(2)) + a(3-a(2))
a(3) = a(1) + a(3-1) =
a(3) = 1+1 = 2

Therefore, the 3rd value of the sequence a(3) is 2.

The sequence a(n) seems simple enough: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, ...
Try computing a few additional numbers.  Can you find any interesting
patterns?  The prolific mathematician John H Conway presented this
recursive sequence at a recent talk entitled "Some Crazy Sequences."  He
noticed that the value a(n)/n approaches 1/2 as the sequence grows and n
becomes larger.  Can you find a value, N, above which the sequence the
value of a(n)/n is always within 0.05 of the value 1/2?  (In other
words,
.eq vbar a(n)/n -1/2 vbar lt 0.05.
The bars indicate the absolute value.)

   A difficult problem? you ask.
John Conway offered $10,000 to the person to find the s-m-a-l-l-e-s-t
such N. A month after Conway made the offer, Colin Mallows of AT&T
solved the $10,000 question:  N = 3,173,375,556.  Manfred Shroeder has
noted that the sequence is "replete with appealing self-similarities
that contain the clue to the problem's solution."  Can you find any
self-similarities?  As I write this, no-one on the planet has found a
value for the smallest N such that a(n)/n is always within 0.01 of the
value 1/2.
.eq (vbar a(n)/n -1/2 vbar lt 0.01. )

off the top, we can see that on the 2^k (k a pos. int) terms, the
ratio goes to .5

between each of these, the ratio goes up and then drops back to .5
(ignoring the variances due to integer arithmatic)

the value of n at the maximum in each jump is halfway between the two
2^k points.  The value of a(n) at those points seems to be
2^(k-1) - f(k), where f(k) is some function that I cannot determine

Therefore, we must find a value of x such that...
(2^(x-1)-f(x))/2^x - .5 <.05 (or whatever)

f(x)/2^x < .05

and then N would be .5*(2^x-2^(x-1))

As I pointed out in my posting, this is incorrect, and differs from
Mallows' correct answer published in his article. But a bit of
investigation shows that the above N is hardly a random guess, either.
Conway's sequence is best understood by analyzing it on "levels",
where the   k'th level is the set of integers between  2^k  and 2^(k+1).
It turns out that Mallows' correct answer, 6083008742, lies on level 32,
and the largest candidate answer on level 31 is  N=3173375556, the
number quoted above.

Where did you see the above value of N given as the answer to Conway's

Thus if m+1 is then sum when the series is based off m, then m+2 is then
