What is the solution to _Masquerade_ by Kit Williams?

==> references/books/masquerade.s <==
The original book:
_Masquerade_ by Kit Williams, Jonathan Cape, London, 1979 

The answer book:
_Masquerade The Complete Book with the Answer Explained_ by Kit Williams,
    Jonathan Cape, London, 1982 

The whole story:
_The Quest for the Golden Hare_ by Bamber Gascoigne, Jonathan Cape,
    London, 1983

_Masquerade_  contains fifteen very detailed one- or two-page paintings
rendered in the fantastic style typical of a high quality children's
book, together with a dreamy story containing characters such as Jack
Hare, Tara Tree-tops and the Lady Moon.  Most of the very lifelike
people in the paintings are actual friends of Mr. Williams.  This book
set off a frenzy of solving activity unequalled by any subsequent book,
even though its imitators offered much higher prizes, culminating in
the $500,000 of the book _Treasure_ with puzzle by Paul Hoffman (a.k.a.
Dr. Crypton).

The solution to Masquerade is simplicity itself, and is fully in
keeping with the nature of the book: namely, a picture book.  First of
all, the text has nothing to do with it; the pictures alone contain the
answer.  Secondly, the answer is literally pointed to by the pictures.
Each picture is bordered by letters, which is a dead giveaway since the
letters have no reason for being there if they are not part of the
puzzle.  By drawing a line from the eyes of the various creatures in
the pictures, through their longest fingers, biggest toes, etc., and
extending to the bordering letters, this message is found:

CATHERINES LONG FINGER OVER SHADOWS EARTH BURIED YELLOW AMULET MIDDAY
POINTS THE HOUR IN LIGHT OF EQUINOX LOOK YOU.

The first letter from each page spells: 
CLOSE BY AMPTHILL 

This method of solution is hinted to on the title page with the rhyme: 
    To solve the hidden riddle, you must use your eyes,
    And find the hare in every picture that may point you to the prize. 

Armed with this information, it is a simple matter to discover that
there is a statue of Catherine of Aragon in a public park near the
village of Ampthill.  By doing a little amateur astronomy, the exact
spot pointed to by the statue's long finger can be determined without
waiting for the equinox.  Beneath this spot was the treasure, a golden
hare.  The book also contains a number of confirming clues.

_Quest_ chronicles some of the amazingly far-fetched approaches taken
by Masqueraders.  Mr. Gascoigne, a respected author on the arts,
accompanied Mr.  Williams the night he buried the treasure.  He also
read the tens of thousands of letters received by Mr. Williams.   The
hare was found three years after the book was published by a shadowy
figure with pseudonym Ken Thomas.  Mr. "Thomas" found the hare by
researching Mr. Williams' life, going to places that he had lived, and
doing a lot of digging with the occasional help of some of the
confirming clues.  Two British physicists did finally solve the puzzle
with the help of a hint published by Mr. Williams in the Sunday Times,
but they were a little too late.

After the announcement that the hare was unearthed, many fanatical
Masqueraders tried to prove that their approaches could lead to the
correct solution.  For example, someone discovered that the word
"thill" means a fleck of paint (according to some obscure dictionary),
and he thought he saw an inexplicable fleck of paint in each painting.
He also thought he saw the word "amp" hidden in each painting.  For
example, in one picture a girl is floating in the air above houses.
And a volt (vault) over an ohm (home) is an amp.  Mr. Gascoigne
summarizes his observations thus:

    Tens of thousands of letters from Masqueraders have convinced me that
    the human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and
    self-deception.  While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle,
    others were more single-mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the
    hare quite regardless of the news that it had been found.  Their own
    theories had come to seem so convincing that no exterior evidence could
    refute them. These most determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have
    accepted that a hare of some sort was dug up at Ampthill, but they
    believed there would be another hare, or a better solution, awaiting
    them at their favourite spot.  Kit would expect them to continue
    undismayed by the much publicised diversion at Ampthill and would be
    looking forward to the day when he would greet them as the real
    discoverers of the real puzzle of Masquerade.  Optimistic expeditions
    were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the summer of
    1982.

What is the solution to _Maze_ by Christopher Manson?

==> references/books/maze.s <==
In room 29, a door to room 17 is hidden to look like a table.  Using this door
this 16-step tour exists: 1 26 30 42 4 29 17 45 23 8 12 39 4 15 37 20 1.

The riddle of room 45 remains to be solved.


==> references/books/treasure.p <==
What is the solution to _Treasure_ by Dr. Crypton?

==> references/books/treasure.s <==
"Treasure" was a puzzle by Dr. Crypton (Paul Hoffman) released
simultaneously in 1984 as a book, a videotape and a laserdisk.  The book
and video versions include a number of mysterious pictures and images
connected by a loose plot involving the theft of a golden horse.  The
1-kilo golden horse itself was buried, and the mysterious images were
supposed to give instructions on how to find it.  The lucky winners would
get the golden horse and $500,000.  The clues were interesting and
obscure; it was impossible to tell which of the puzzles were relevant to
the solution and which weren't.  Enough of them were sort of solvable to
give people hope that they were on the right track.  For example, some
clues written on an umbrella gave the birth and death years of Mary, Queen
of Scots; and a chess game turned out to be identifiable as Anderssen vs.
Kieseritzky, the "Shower of Gold" game.  Evidently neither of these
observations was relevant to the solution in the end.

It was alleged that during the production of the video enough people
were let in on the secret that the location had to be changed... but
that very little of the puzzle was changed to reflect the new location.

Nobody solved the puzzle in time -- i.e. by midnight of 26 May 1989.
The horse was dug up by the promoters and the prize donated to a charity:
Big Brothers and Sisters of America.  However, the promoters and Dr.
Crypton refused to make the solution public.  Seven months later two
men, Nick Boone and Anthony Castaneda, went to Tennessee Pass in Colorado
and dug up a vial with congratulations inside.  They wrote a description
of their thought processes that left other frustrated treasure-seekers
suspicious and annoyed: their "solution" appeared to be motivated very
little by anything in the puzzle itself, so that it seemed apparent to
many that they were virtually guided to that location by the promoters.
This suspicion has not been confirmed or denied.

==> references/books/unnamed.p <==
What is the solution to the unnamed book by Kit Williams?

==> references/books/unnamed.s <==
The title is "The Bee on the Comb."

In the first picture, there are two "hybrid" animals, one half-mouse,
half-horse, the other half-cat, half-toad.  If you've read
"Masquerade", the drawings remind you of the circle of animals in one
of the pictures in that book, and there's even a footnote there
explaining the names of the animals in that picture.  Using the same
reasoning, the two animals in "The Bee on the Comb" ought to be called
a "morse" and a "coad".  So the obvious conclusion is that this is a
clue indicating that Morse code is involved.  The Morse code is around
the frame of the gardening picture, and spells out "All animals are
equal in a tale of tail to tail, end to end to end."  This is the same
message that is around the picture in "Masquerade."

Each picture in "The Bee on the Comb" contains a hidden animal.  Ignore
all the naturalistic animals: you're looking just for one animal hidden
in some visually punning way.  For example, in the first picture,
there's a parrot hidden in the young man's vest--turn the page upside
down and the leaves pictured on his vest become the parrot's feathers.

If you write down all fifteen hidden animals and take their last
letters, "end to end to end", it spells out "The Bee on the Comb".  I
recall that we found the hidden animal in the picture on the kitchen
(the one with the box of Oxo cubes on the mantel) particularly
difficult to find, though I expect that'll vary from person to person.
The hidden animals are wonderfully cleverly hidden.  Oh, and the animal
ending in C is rather obscure; I think we had to figure out its name
only after we'd figured out the title of the book and knew it ended in
C.

If you count the number of bees in each picture and convert it to
letters, using A = 1, B = 2, etc., you get "Bees Only Sting".  By
looking at the honeycomb that obscures the title on the cover, you can
see how many letters the words in the title contain, and "Bees Only
Sting" does not work.

There's at least one other indication that the bees are a red herring.  The
fourth line from the end of the text reads "the bees they are of little
consequence".  I'm not positive that this isn't a coincidence, but it sure
looks like it might be a message to ignore the bees.

This is the sci.skeptic FAQ.  It is intended to provide a factual base
for most of the commonly discussed topics on sci.skeptic.
Unfortunately I don't have much time to do this in, and anyway a FAQ
should be the Distilled Wisdom of the Net rather than just My Arrogant

sci.skeptic topic are welcomed, but please keep them short and to the
point.  The ideal submission is a short summary with one or two
references to other literature.  I have added comments in square

    enigmas.  Each issue also includes a member-written cryptic.  Members
    get to pick a "nom" (nom de plume), e.g. I'm Cubist and Chris Cole
    is Canon.  The NPL is a somewhat specialized organization, so you
    should send a SASE with a request for a mini-sample to the editor
    to see if it's for you.
