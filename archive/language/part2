==> language/english/pronunciation/homophone/trivial.p <==
Consider the free non-abelian group on the twenty-six letters of the
alphabet with all relations of the form <word1> = <word2>, where <word1>
and <word2> are homophones (i.e. they sound alike but are spelled
differently).  Show that every letter is trivial.

For example, be = bee, so e is trivial.

==> language/english/pronunciation/homophone/trivial.s <==
be = bee ==> e is trivial;
ail = ale ==> i is trivial;
week = weak ==> a is trivial;
lie = lye ==> y is trivial;
to = too ==> o is trivial;
two = to ==> w is trivial;
hour = our ==> h is trivial;
faggot = fagot ==> g is trivial;
bowl = boll ==> l is trivial;
gell = jel ==> j is trivial;
you = ewe ==> u is trivial;
damn = dam ==> n is trivial;
limb = limn ==> b is trivial;
bass = base ==> s is trivial;
cede = seed ==> c is trivial;
knead = need ==> k is trivial;
add = ad ==> d is trivial;
awful = offal ==> f is trivial;
gram = gramme ==> m is trivial;
grip = grippe ==> p is trivial;
cue = queue ==> q is trivial;
carrel = carol ==> r is trivial;
butt = but ==> t is trivial;
lox = locks ==> x is trivial;
tsar = czar ==> z is trivial;
vlei = flay ==> v is trivial.

For a related problem, see _The Jimmy's Book_ (_The American Mathematical
Monthly_, Vol. 93, Num. 8 (Oct. 1986), p.  637):

Consider the free group on twenty-six letters A, ..., Z.  Mod out by
the relation that defines two words to be equivalent if (a) one is a
permutation of the other and (b) each appears as a legitimate English
word in the dictionary.  Identify the center of this group.

==> language/english/pronunciation/rhyme.p <==
What English words are hard to rhyme?

"Rhyme is the identity in sound of an accented vowel in a word...and
of all consonantal and vowel sounds following it; with a difference in
the sound of the consonant immediately preceding the accented vowel."
(From The Complete Rhyming Dictionary by Clement Wood).  Appropriately
Wood says a couple of pages later, "If a poet commences, 'October is
the wildest month' he has estopped himself from any rhyme; since
"month" has no rhyme in English."

`eox' be on the list?

==> language/english/self.ref/self.ref.letters.p <==
Construct a true sentence of the form: "This sentence contains _ a's, _ b's,
_ c's, ...," where the numbers filling in the blanks are spelled out.

==> language/english/self.ref/self.ref.letters.s <==
A little history of the problem, culled from the pages of _Metamagical
Themas_, Hofstadter's collection of his _Scientific American_ columns.
First mention of it is in the Jan. '82 column.  Lee Sallows opened the
field with a sentence that began "Only the fool would take trouble to
verify that his sentence was composed of ten a's ...." etc.

Then in the addendum to the Jan.'83 column on viral sentences, Hofstadter
quotes Sallows describing his Pangram Machine, "a clock-driven cascade of
sixteen Johnson-counters," to tackle the problem. An early success was:
        "This pangram tallies five a's, one b, one c, two d's, twenty-
        eight e's, eight f's, six g's, eight h's, thirteen i's, one j,
        one k, three l's, two m's, eighteen n's, fifteen o's, two p's,
        one q, seven r's, twenty-five s's, twenty-two t's, four u's, four
        v's, nine w's, two x's, four y's, and one z."

Sallows wagered ten guilders that no-one could create a perfect self-
documenting sentence beginning, "This computer-generated pangram contains
...." within ten years.

It was solved very quickly, after Sallows' challenge appeared in Dewdney's
Oct. '84 SA column.  Larry Tesler solved it by a method Hofstadter calls
"Robinsonizing," which involves starting with an arbitrary set of values
for each letter, getting the true values when the sentence is made, and
plugging the new values back in, making a feedback loop. Eventually, you
can zero in on a set of values that work.  Tesler's sentence:
        This computer-generated pangram contains six a's, one b, three
        c's, three d's, thirty-seven e's, six f's, three g's, nine h's,
        twelve i's, one j, one k, two l's, three m's, twenty-two n's,
        thirteen o's, three p's, one q, fourteen r's, twenty-nine s's,
        twenty-four t's, five u's, six v's, seven w's, four x's, five
        y's, and one z.

The method of solution (called "Robinsonizing," after the logician Raphael
Robinson) is as follows:
1)      Fix the count of a's.
2)      Fix the count of b's.
3)      Fix the count of c's.
...
26)   Fix the count of z's.
Then, if the sentence is still wrong, go back to step 1.
 
Most attempts will fall into long loops (what Hofstadter calls attractive
orbits), but with a good computer program, it's not too hard to find a
Robinsonizing sequence that zeros in on a fixed set of values.

The February and May 1992 _Word Ways_ have articles on this subject,
titled "In Quest of a Pangram, (Part 1)" by Lee Sallows.  It tells of his
search for a self-referential pangram of the form, "This pangram
contains _ a's, ..., and one z."  (He built special hardware to search
for them.)  Two such pangrams given in the article are:

    This pangram lists four a's, one b, one c, two d's,
    twenty-nine e's, eight f's, three g's, five h's, eleven i's,
    one j, one k, three l's, two m's twenty-two n's, fifteen o's,
    two p's, one q, seven r's, twenty-six s's, nineteen t's, four
    u's, five v's, nine w's, two x's, four y's, and one z.

    This pangram contains four a's, one b, two c's, one d, thirty
    e's, six f's, five g's, seven h's, eleven i's, one j, one k,
    two l's, two m's eighteen n's, fifteen o's, two p's, one q,
    five r's, twenty-seven s's, eighteen t's, two u's, seven v's,
    eight w's, two x's, three y's, & one z.

It also contains one in Dutch by Rudy Kousbroek:

    Dit pangram bevat vijf a's, twee b's, twee c's, drie d's,
    zesenveertig e's, vijf f's, vier g's, twee h's, vijftien i's,
    vier j's, een k, twee l's, twee m's, zeventien n's, een o,
    twee p's, een q, zeven r's, vierentwintig s's, zestien t's,

==> language/english/sentences/pangram.s <==
The single-letter words that have meanings unrelated to their letter shapes
or sounds, position in the alphabet, etc. are:
a - indefinite article; on; in; at; to; he; him; she; her; they; them; it; I;
    have; of; all
c - 100; cocaine; programming language
d - 500
e - base of natural logs; eccentricity; enlarging
g - acceleration of gravity; general ability; $1000; general audience
i - one; unit vector in x direction; personal pronoun; in; aye
j - one; unit vector in y direction
k - 1000; 1024; strikeout; unit vector in z direction
l - 50; ell; elevated railroad
m - 1000; em; pica; an antigen of human blood
n - an indefinite number; en; an antigen of human blood
o - oh
q - quality of oscillatory circuit
R - one of the three Rs; restricted audience
t - t-shirt
u - upper class
v - five
w - w particle
x - unknown quantity; atmospherics; adults only
y - unknown quantity; YMCA
z - unknown quantity; buzzing sound; z particle
It is therefore advisable to exclude single-letter words, with the
possible exception of 'a'.

As always, word acceptability varies with the dictionaries used.  We use these:
9C  - Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1986
NI3 - Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 1961
NI2 - Merriam-Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, 1935
OED - Oxford English Dictionary with Supplements, 1933 - 85
'+' indicates obsolete, dialectical, slang, or otherwise substandard word.

	XYZ (at 'X')

The first time I saw this pangram was in Gyles Brandeth's _The Joy of Lex_.
It appeared there as:

Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud.  (7 words, 28 letters, proper noun.)

I always wondered why they didn't try modifying it as:

Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex buds.  (7 words, 29 letters, no proper noun.)

However, why fast dances would irritate incipient flowers is beyond me,
so I tried again:

Waltz, dumb nymph, for quick jigs vex.  (7 words, 29 letters, no proper noun,
					 makes more sense.)

However, sounds kind of sexist, and we can maybe chop off a letter and
eliminate the sexism, although suffering some loss of sense:

Waltz, bud nymph, for quick jigs vex.  (7 words, 28 letters, no proper noun,
					makes less sense.)

There are river nymphs and tree nymphs and mountain nymphs, so there can
be nymphs of the aforementioned incipent flowers, right?  Sense is a matter
of opinion, so you can move the bud around or turn it into another imperative
verb rather than a noun-as-adjective:

Waltz, nymph, bud, for quick jigs vex.  (7 words, 28 letters, no proper noun,
					 sense is dubious.)
[We've all heard of budding youth, right?]

Waltz, nymph, for quick bud jigs vex.  (7 words, 28 letters, no proper noun,
					sense is dubious.)
[Yeah, we've all learned to dance a merry jig that looks like one of those
infamous incipient flowers.]

Dub waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex.  (7 words, 28 letters, no proper noun,
					came up with this on the spot and
					actually it looks pretty good!)
[The idea being that a nymph, being in control of the soundtrack for a TV
sitcom, has to change the music to which a grandmother is listening, from
something from Ireland to something from Strauss.]

    -- Stephen Joseph Smith <sjsmith@cs.umd.edu>

It is fairly straightforward, if time-consuming, to search for minimal
pangrams given a suitable lexicon, and the enclosed program does this. 
The run time is of the order of 20 MIPS-days if fed `Official Scrabble
Words', a document nominally listing all sufficiently short words
playable in tournament Scrabble in Britain.

I also enclose a lexicon which will reproduce the OSW results much more
quickly.

The results are dominated by onomatopoeic interjections (`pst', `sh',
etc.), and words borrowed from Welsh (`cwm', `crwth') and Arabic (`qat',
`suq').  Other lexicons will contain a very different leavening of such
words, and yield a very different set of pangrams.

Readers are invited to form sentences (or, less challenging, newspaper
headlines) from these pangrams.  Few are amenable to this sort of thing.

==> language/english/sentences/repeated.words.p <==
What is a sentence with the same word several times repeated?  Do not use
quotation marks, proper names, a language other than English, or anything
else distasteful.

==> language/english/sentences/repeated.words.s <==
Five "had"s in a row:

The parents were unable to conceive, so they hired someone else to
be a surrogate.

The parents had had a surrogate have their child.

The parents had had had their child.

The child had had no breakfast.

The child whose parents had had had had had no breakfast.

It is arguably possible to construct sentences with arbitrarily many
repetitions of a word.  For example:

1. Bulldogs fight
2. Bulldogs bulldogs fight fight.
    (i.e., bulldogs (that) bulldogs fight, (themselves) fight)
3. Bulldogs bulldogs bulldogs fight fight fight.
    (i.e., bulldogs (that) bulldogs (that) bulldogs fight, (themselves) fight,
    (themselves) fight)
...
n. etc.

From the May, 1990 _Word Ways_:

That is IE - Or, Is That EI?

by Paul Leopold
Stockholm, Sweden

    "Seeing wherein neither weirdly-veiled sovereign deigned
    agreeing, their feisty heirs, leisurely eyeing eight heinous
    deity-freightened reindeer sleighs, counterfeited spontaneity,
    freeing rein (reveille, neighing!); forfeited obeisance,
    fleeing neighborhood.  Kaleidoscopically-veined foreign
    heights being seized, either reigned, sleight surfeited,
    therein; reinvented skein-dyeing; reiteratedly inveighed,
    feigning weighty seismological reinforcement."

The above passage appears in a book on the ecological conservation
measures of the enlightened plutocracies of antiquity, Ancient
Financier Aristocracies' Conscientious Scientific Species Policies,
by Creighton Leigh Peirce and Keith Leiceister Reid. . . .

Any beings decreeing such ogreish, albeit nonpareil,
homogeneity must be nucleic protein-deficient from sauteing
pharmacopoeial caffeine and codeine!

==> language/english/spelling/gry.p <==
Find three completely different words ending in "gry."

==> language/english/spelling/gry.s <==
Aside from "angry" and "hungry" and words derived therefrom, there is
only one word ending with "-gry" in Webster's Third Unabridged: "aggry."
However, this word is defective in that it is part of a phrase "aggry beads."
The OED's usage examples all talk about "aggry beads."

Moving to older dictionaries, we find that "gry" itself is a word in Webster's
Second Unabridged (and the OED):

gry, n. [L. gry, a trifle; Gr. gry, a grunt]
   1. a measure equal to one-tenth of a line. [Obs.] (Obs. = obsolete)
   2. anything very small. [Rare.]

This is a list of 100 words, phrases and names ending in "gry":

This list is almost certainly not complete.  For example, on
page 187 of Beyond Language, Dmitri Borgmann has "Udruj" in a
word list.  What reference he dug this word out of is unknown;
the combined efforts of the NPL electronic mailing list could
not produce the source of this word.  So additions to this list
will be welcomed by the author.

==> language/english/spelling/lipograms.p <==
What books have been written without specific letters, vowels, etc.?

==> language/english/spelling/lipograms.s <==
Such a book is called a lipogram.

A novel-length example in English (omitting e) exists, titled _Gadsby_.

Georges Perec wrote a French novel titled _La Disparition_ which does
not contain the letter 'e',  except in a few bits of text that the
publisher had to include in or on the book somewhere -- such as the
author's name :-).  But these were all printed in red, making them
somehow ``not count''.

Perec also wrote another novel in which `e' was the only vowel.

In _La Disparition_, unlike _Gadsby_, the lipogrammatic
technique is reflected in the story.  Objects disappear or become
invisible.  We know, however, more or less why the characters can't
find things like eggs or even remember their names -- because the
words for them can't be used.

Amazingly, it's been ``translated'' into English (by Harry Mathews, I
think).

Another work which manages to [almost] adhere to restrictive
alphabetic rules while also remaining readable as well as providing
amusement and literary satisfaction (though you have to like
disjointed fiction) is _Alphabetical Africa_ by Walter Abish.  The
rules (which of course he doesn't explain, you can't help noticing
most of them) have to do with initial letters of words.  There are 52
chapters.  In the first, all words begin with `a'; in the second, all
words begin with either `a' or `b'; etc, until all words are allowed
in chapter 26.  Then in the second half, the letters are taken away
one by one.  It's remarkable when, for instance, you finally get `the'
and realize how much or little you missed it; earlier, when `I' comes
in, you feel something like the difference between third- and
first-person narration.  As one of the blurbs more or less says (I
don't have it here to quote), reading this is like slowly taking a
deep breath and letting it out again.

==> language/english/spelling/longest.p <==
What is the longest word in the English language?

==> language/english/spelling/longest.s <==
The longest word to occur in both English and American "authoritative"
unabridged dictionaries is "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis."

The following is a brief citation history of this "word."

New York Herald Tribune, February 23, 1935, p. 3
"Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosis succeeded
electrophotomicrographically as the longest word in the English
language recognized by the National Puzzlers' League at the opening
session of the organization's 103d semi-annual meeting held yesterday
at the Hotel New Yorker.

The puzzlers explained that the forty-five-letter word is the name of a
special form of silicosis caused by ultra-microscopic particles of
siliceous volcanic dust."

Everett M. Smith (b. 1/1/1894), President of NPL and Radio News Editor
of the Christian Science Monitor, cited the word at the convention.
Smith was also President of the Yankee Puzzlers of Boston.
It is not known whether Smith coined the word.

"Bedside Manna. The Third Fun in Bed Book.", edited by Frank Scully,
Simon and Schuster, New York, 1936, p. 87
"There's been a revival in interest in spelling, but Greg Hartswick,
the cross word king and world's champion speller, is still in control
of the situation.  He'd never get any competition from us, that's
sure, though pronouncing, let alone spelling, a 44 letter word like:
        Pneumonoultramicrosopicsilicovolkanakoniosis,
a disease caused by ultra-microscopic particles of sandy volcanic dust
might give even him laryngitis."

It is likely that Scully, who resided in New York in February 1935,
read the Herald Tribune article and slightly misremembered the word.

Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary, 1936
Both "-coniosis" and "-koniosis" are cited.
"a factitious word alleged to mean 'a lung disease caused by the inhalation
of very fine silica dust' but occurring chiefly as an instance of a very long
word."

Webster's first cite is "-koniosis" in the addendum to the Second Edition.
The Third Edition changes the "-koniosis" to "-coniosis."

I conjecture that this "word" was coined by word puzzlers, who then
worked assiduously to get it into the major unabridged dictionaries
(perhaps with a wink from the editors?)  to put an end to the endless
squabbling about what is the longest word.
